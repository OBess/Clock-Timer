## A brief review of the application
This project represents a clock (analog and digit) with a timer. Like a user, you can see the current time; like a user, you can select a time on the circle of an analog clock or type numbers in the digit clock and start a timer; after that, you can restart and stop the timer; when timer stopped, there will be a record in the history table with current date and time, and interval of work timer. You can clear the table and unselect the selected time like a user. Also, the application can save data before closing and restore it after the start of the application. All functions are the same for the Android version, except that the clocks and the history table are in different tabs.
